Basically, I want to learn how to solve problems using the Ruby programming language. This repository will hold the code to my solution attempts from challenges found in the `Pragmatic Programmers Best of Ruby Quiz` book. There are a total of twenty-five (25) different problems in the book. If you're like me, I encourage that you purchase a copy of the book as well.

**Note:** I do not include the problems in here, for obvious reasons.

### Challenges
Here are some of the different challenges by name.

* Mad Libs
* LCD Numbers
* GEDCOM Parser
* Animal Quiz
* Scrabble Stems
* Regexp.build()
* HighLine
* Roman Numerals
* Rock, Paper, Scissors
* Knight's Travails
* ... and more!
