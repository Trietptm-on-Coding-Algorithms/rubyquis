/rub,ee'kwiz/
=====

Basically, I want to learn Ruby, and solve problems. In an attempt to be somewhat **awesome** at _rubying_ (is this a real word?), I want to try out some of the Ruby challenges found in The Pragmatic Programmers Best of Ruby Quiz book. There are twenty-five (25) different problems in the book. This repository will hold the code to my solution attempts.

## Challenges
Here are some of the different challenges by name.

* Mad Libs
* LCD Numbers
* GEDCOM Parser
* Animal Quiz
* Scrabble Stems
* Regexp.build()
* HighLine
* Roman Numerals
* Rock, Paper, Scissors
* Knight's Travails
* ... and more!
